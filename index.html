    <h1>Business Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Live sound Engineer</h2>
    <p>Live sound engineer based in the West Midlands focused on producing the highest quality mix for clients.I have
      been working as a sound engineer in some capacity since the age of 16 and studied Music Production at BIMM
      Birmingham.
      My aim is to work as a front of house engineer for bands performing at venues, festivals and with theatre groups

      Initially working with musicians and theatre groups in the West Midlands. By reaching out to local venues that put

    <h2>Music Producer </h2>

      local artists. I am an accomplished guitar player and play in a band in my free time.

      I wish to provide high-quality services to solo artists and bands to ensure their music sounds its very best.
      Initially, focusing on artists in the West Midlands area.
      <br>
      <br>
      I will contact local recording studios, leaving my details, to see if any of the bands require someone to mix or
      produce. I will go to local venues to network with live artists and introduce myself. I will set up a website and
      social media accounts.

    <h2>Session Musician</h2>
    <p>
      I am a grade 8 guitar player. Additionally, I play multiple instruments including bass, violin, ukulele and
      saxophone. I have played in bands and musical ensembles since the age of eleven. I have played different genre
      ranging from rock, indie, reggae and jazz.
      <br>
      <br>
      I aim to use my skills and knowledge to work as a freelance session player working on studio recordings and live
      performances in musical theatre. I have the skills and knowledge to play a range of musical genres meeting
      client's
      needs. I am happy to play any genre but specialise in rock, indie and jazz. I would like to develop my saxophone
      playing further by studying online using online videos and have one to one teaching over the next two years. This
      will broaden my employability skills. Initially, I will work in person and once I have built up experience and
      examples of my work. I will advertise to work online for clients, who prefer me to record the parts and send it
      directly to them.
      <br>
      <br>
      I will build a website that presents the broad scope of the work I have done to date, covering diverse projects
      and
      musical styles. This will have a range of examples to show any prospective client. I will market it through paid
      online advertising on search engines. I will contact local theatres and theatre production companies giving them
      my
      business card.
      <br>
      <br>
      I will continue to go to gigs to ensure I get to know a lot of other musicians, promoters and managers to ensure
      my
      network grows. If I I see a band or artist whose music Iike, I will talk with them after the gig. I will follow
      this
      up with a message letting them know that I really enjoyed their gig and if they were ever looking for a session
      player I am available.
      <br>
      <br>
      I will research and visit all the local recording studios and introduce myself and leave my business card.
